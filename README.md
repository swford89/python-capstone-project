## Analyzing the tone of tweets
This project uses the tweepy module to get tweets and the Tone Analyzer from IBMs watson module to analyze the tone of the tweets

## API-Documentation
- [IBM Cloud Creating Resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manage_resource)
- [IBM Tone Analyzer](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/tone-analyzer?code=python#tone)

 **You need to create the cloud resource and use the credentials that are generated upon creation (API key and endpoint URL) first, on your IBM cloud account**

**If you just generate an API key, you'll get a `403: Forbidden` error**
